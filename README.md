### A brief overview of our project's history and achievements

We embarked on the journey of building FrenTube approximately 3-4 months ago with a clear missionâ€”to establish a decentralized platform connecting creators with their fans. Our core belief was that users shouldn't be treated as products. In the past month, we've witnessed significant interest from prominent creators in the space, including notable figures like Kusamarian and many others.

However, despite the positive attention, the majority of our users expressed dissatisfaction. The entry barrier proved to be too high, as users needed a considerable number of tokens just to post short clips.
